    - Grow self-motivation and time management skills: 
        1. Make mistakes. Obviously don't go out of my way to cause problems, but when i do have a lapse in good behaviour, I don't need to "beat myself up" for it.
        2. Learn from them and figure out what caused them in the first place.
        3. Adapt my life(e.g. Schedule, Behaviour, Mentality, Mental model, etc.) as needed to avoid any future similiar problems from occuring. 
        4. Celebrate milestones, big progress and reward good behaviour.

        1. Learning mentality. Accept setbacks as challenges, instead. Be persistent and embrace it.
        2. Stay curious. If I'm going to get the skills needed for a career in softwarre development, I'm never going to stop learning - especially when the tech world is always changing and evloving.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - - Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals. - -
    - - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges. - -

    - Lack of concentration
        - When I feel my concentration starting to slip, i'll need to get away from the content(and desk) for a while.
        - Either do some household chores, take a 30-40min catnap(or go to sleep, depending on how tired I am or how late it is) or do something recreational for an hour max. Get my mind of the problem for a while, then come back with a fresh mind.
    - Fixed mental model of the work: I might struggle to take in data if it contradicts with my mental model of the work
        - this is where developing my learning mentality is important.
        - Take every contradiction, not as something to prove wrong, but as something to further my knowledge of the subject and that can make future struggles lessen (or non-excistent :D ).
    - Lack of time to complete set work: As proven by this week, it can get hectick.
        - As soon as I get the work assigned, I do it as efficiently as possable (without compromising my studies).
        - If the week looks like it's going to be really busy, or if I know my personal life is going to interfere, get a headstart on the content. 

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - - Highlight any opportunities you can leverage for career growth. - -
    - - Include networking, mentorship, or educational opportunities. - -
